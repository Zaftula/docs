---
Message-ID, sometimes shortened to msgid, is a unique identifier assigned to individual email messages by the email server responsible for sending the message. 
SendGrid will create a Message-ID for each individual message you send through our systems, with the exception of email sent using direct SMTP integration. This Message-ID information can be viewed in certain events in the SendGrid Activity Feed as well as Event Webhook POST data.

Example SendGrid Message-ID: **Message-ID: <9aOFU_fzTWeU_5rWZUNWVw@ismtpd0006p1iad1.sendgrid.net>**
